🔥 FLAMES but Make It Chaotic 💘

FLAMES but Make It Chaotic is a fun, Gen-Z themed matchmaking Progressive Web App that reimagines the classic childhood FLAMES game into a modern, meme-worthy compatibility experience. Instead of simply matching names, this app analyses zodiac signs derived from date of birth, personality vibes selected by the users, and even the energy from uploaded selfies to calculate a realistic (but still chaotic) compatibility percentage.

The app allows two users to enter their names, dates of birth, personality traits, and upload or capture a selfie directly from their device. Using this information, it generates a compatibility score, predicts the “situationship risk,” and delivers humorous roasts based on zodiac personality traits and photo vibes. The zodiac compatibility is not random — it is calculated using a structured compatibility matrix, making the results feel more believable while still keeping the experience entertaining.

Beyond compatibility, the app also adds a playful twist by analysing personality alignment and age differences, creating a balance between realism and fun. The selfie input adds another layer of meme-style commentary, turning the output into a full “vibe check” rather than just a match result.

Designed with a glassmorphism aesthetic and chaotic Gen-Z tone, the app feels less like a traditional form-based calculator and more like an interactive relationship report. Once hosted, it can be installed as a Progressive Web App, allowing users to download and run it like a mobile application directly from their home screen.
